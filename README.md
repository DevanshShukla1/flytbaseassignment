# flytbaseassignment
An attempt to manuever drone in flytbase simulator
I managed to do manuevere in square trajectory but was unable to do triangular trajectory,
However I have learned many things related to UAV in this process, How to configure WSL with Ubuntu install Gazebo and ROS , failing to install gazebo, try new methods. I learnt a lot inthese 2 days thanks
